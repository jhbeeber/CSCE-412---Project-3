# Load-Balancer
Load balancer developed using C++. Generates random in and out IP addresses at random times. Webserver takes requests from the load balancer queue, processes the request, and prompts for more requests. Load balancer keeps a dynamic queue of the web requests and keeps track of time as clock cycles.
